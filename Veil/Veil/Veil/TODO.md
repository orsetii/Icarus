# TODO

- Figure out how we access maps offline? Local tile server is certainly option: https://openmaptiles.org/docs/
- Localize highcharts js files
- Edit the tempuratures on tempurartures graph to have the time in HH:mm format.
- Add capability for multiple serieselements in WeatherChart
- Implement low network traffic mode, which will perform zero automatic requests, and will require user interaction for any requests to be sent.
- TESTING!!
