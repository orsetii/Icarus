# TODO

- Figure out how we access maps offline? Local tile server is certainly option: https://openmaptiles.org/docs/
- Localize highcharts js files
- Edit the tempuratures on tempurartures graph to have the time in HH:mm format.
- TESTING!!


## Weather
- Weather use the location on the most recent data, and show those coords on the map. 
- Save each weather result we pull from server, into json files. Manage these files, 
  deleting old ones and using 'nearby' weather results if we have a recent forecast stored.
- Searchable list of locations (cities, etc.) with their coords, for offline usage, this could be
  used in Maps also to 'goto' that location.


## Stock 

- Figure out what data we need, add to various classes.
- Implement, groupable, sortable, datagrids (mudblazor looks rly good for this.)


## Literature

- FINISH GETTING entire of wikipedia into a usable format, think that https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia
  is the best way to do this.
- Create classes properly from the wiki mongo JSON.


## Testing 

- Start
