# Philosophy of the Van

There enlies a problem with  how to approach the construction of not just 'the van' but
also the 'vanlife'. 

Should the life I live be about 'how nice the van is' or rather 'how happy the life is'?

One could say both is possible, but what has always been important to me, is ensuring the 
'van' has *personality*. It's where I live, it cant be some souless plastic construction,
with pure functionality. That defeats the entire point, of living free, moving where you please,
when you please.

So, not just the construction of the interior of the van is called into question here,
but which van model to buy in the first place. Of course, the optimal for highest living
standard is a long wheelbase, high top sprinter or the like. I can fit in a shower, toilet,
heater, tv, full bed, etc, etc.

Then I am not beginning a new life. 

I am transplanting my life, of a privileged, middle class person in the 6th richest country in 
the world, and putting it into a new vessel, now a moving one than a stationary one. I least 
I would own this one though :)

Suffering is not inherently bad, and I don't believe striving away from suffering is 
an absoloute good in terms of leading your life. The depth of your negatives, raise the ceiling for your positives.

Take boredom for example. Each generation that has gone by, (Im not sure re. generations before boomers so we will start there)
boredom for children has been decreasing. My parents, as children would sit around their garden, read books and play with their siblings
and friends. I did similar, however I would watch TV in the mornings, if my parents werent around. Few years after that, the beginning
of the 'iPad kid' started. Where constant stimulation would keep a child occupied the entire day, not a moment without any boredom.
I have also encountered this, but in my later years, where I would nearly always need some music or to be reading something on a website or social media.
And yet, I dont believe this lack of boredom benefited me or people born after me in any particular way. In fact, the attention spans of my
generation (genZ) is disgustingly short, just look at the 20 second family guy clips, with subway surfers gameplay below them.
This makes people hyperactive, and impatient. Not only that, but most importantly, it makes you treasure the fun, the happy moments less.
Boredom, although a very minor form, is a form of suffering (defintion:'the state of undergoing pain, distress, or hardship.').
I believe that suffering, obviously not in the more major forms, can improve your life, and especially increase your apprectiation for living.

With that in mind, I am going to adjust my plans for 'Icarus', luxuries should be treated as such.
