In terms of building the inner parts of the van, everything from electronics to wooden funiture, I will need equipment.

This will be either:
	A. I rent the tools I need (expensive, kinda shitty)
	B. I go to a Makerspace and use their tools to create stuff (might be more hassle, times etc., also its in soton)



## Makerspace

The one most local and actually decent is in southampton, https://somakeit.org.uk.
Will need to go to this after getting the van, cos need to transport stuff back and forth.
